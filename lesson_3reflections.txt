When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  -When I'm working on bigger projects with more people or when I want to stay mobile and have 
  acces to the files at all times (when I have internet).


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	-I want to make sure that the work I'm pulling makes sense, such that someone else can read and understand what is going on. If it was outomatically updated then weird things could be pulled that wound not make sense in the long run.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	-Forks -> copies of someones repositories from guthub to my github
	 clones -> copies of any repository to my local machine
	 branches -> done on the repository to allow for a better work flow.

	Use forks when i want to take someones work :P 
	use clones from friends and colleagues
	branches when i'm working on a project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	-Then you can work from the last known version offline and the risk of having conflicts is less.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	-I would find an online document where me and my friends could work on the project. It would be easier to keep on working but much harder to keep track of changes and see what made the bug.
