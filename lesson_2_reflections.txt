Lesson 2 reflections


What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	-When I initialize a repository I create a .git file that tracks all
	"snapshots" of the versions that I have commited. I need to do this 
	to be able to keep track of my previous work

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	-The staging area handels what you want to save in your next commit. Then you know what you can
	comment for your specific commit.
