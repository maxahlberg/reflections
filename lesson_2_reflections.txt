Lesson 2 reflections


What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	-When I initialize a repository I create a .git file that tracks all
	"snapshots" of the versions that I have commited. I need to do this 
	to be able to keep track of my previous work

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	-The staging area handels what you want to save in your next commit. Then you know what you can
	comment for your specific commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	-You can compare your stating area to both the working directory and the last commit
	 this way it is much easier to know what to include in your next commit.
